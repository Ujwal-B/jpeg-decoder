/* 
 This is the types module
 This provides aliases and types:

 * UInt8, UInt16: unsigned integral types 8-bits and 16-bits wide
 * RGBComponents: identifying the components of RGB colour model pixels
 * Pixel: represents a three-channel pixel with discrete integral range of channel intensities
 * PixelPtr: represents a 2D array of Pixels
 * HuffmanTable: represents a Huffman table with upto 16 length symbols.
